This project is a combination of my two most successful Natural Language Processing projects. 
It involes Finetuning of GPT-2 for text generation, and a training of a sentiment analysis to evaluate each generated quote.
I used the gpt-2-simple by Max Woolf ([@minimaxir](https://minimaxir.com/)) to fine tune GPT-2 with the Quotes-500k from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manann/quotes-500k)
I used this dataset from kaggle to train the sentiment analysis https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140

If you are planning to use this model locally, there is one thing you have to do first:
      download the model checkpoint from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TO6BG5QcBjDyH7jNHuERuIvyNvoW8Hlg?usp=sharing
      download the sentiment analysis model from here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RiCua7ODypSqq9x14aB8L2O-Wng_i-6h?usp=sharing
      place both models in the same folder as the main.ipynb
      go to the "checkpoint" folder 
      open the "checkpoint" file
      change the paths to the location of the "model-17500" (this model is on the same "checkpoint" folder)
      if you have any issue with process, do not hesitate to contact me

Please give credits to Tojo Heriniaina Tsimalay ([@Tojo07](https://github.com/Tojo07)) for any usage of this model
